I\u2019m inferring from your words: up since 8, no breaks, co-founder search, \u201ctired but okay,\u201d and now you\u2019re curious enough to ask about your mental state. That suggests a mix of mental fatigue, some underlying concern/uncertainty about the future, but also a focused, problem-solving mode. I\u2019ll reflect that back simply and ask a small clarifying question so you can tune into it yourself.*\n\nFrom what you\u2019ve shared, it sounds like you\u2019re in a \u201clow-key tired but still pushing forward\u201d state: mentally worn but still engaged and intentional. There\u2019s probably a bit of background stress/uncertainty around finding the right co-founder, but not full-blown overwhelm. If you check in with yourself for a second: does it feel more like \u201cI\u2019m okay, just need rest later\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m quietly running close to empty\u201d?"
