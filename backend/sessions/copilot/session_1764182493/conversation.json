Stress is low (0.13, slightly above your baseline 0.06), heart rate is normal (65 bpm), and cognitive load is mildly elevated (0.29 vs 0.19), with higher beta (22.3%) and gamma (35.7%) suggesting focused thinking/analysis. Alpha is a bit higher too, so you\u2019re not in a panic state\u2014more like \u201cquietly focused, a bit in your head.\u201d Emotional signal says mild sadness, and the \u201cshould intervene\u201d flag suggests you might need a bit of support rather than a clinical-level crisis response. I\u2019ll give you a clear read plus a gentle check-in in case there\u2019s more under the surface.*\n\nFrom what you\u2019ve shared, your mental state right now looks like: mildly stressed, mentally engaged, and a bit sad or reflective\u2014not overwhelmed, but not totally chill either. Your brain activity pattern fits \u201cfocused but emotionally weighed down a bit,\u201d like you\u2019re thinking about something that matters and maybe pokes at some feelings.  \n\nIf you had to put it in your own words, would you say this feels more like:  \na) \u201cI\u2019m fine, just thinking a lot,\u201d  \nb) \u201cI\u2019m low-key not okay,\u201d or  \nc) \u201cI\u2019m really struggling but holding it together\u201d?"

Stress is very low (0.06, same as baseline), heart rate is low but steady (44 bpm), and cognitive load is moderately high (0.45 vs 0.41), with very high gamma (80.1%) and relatively low beta. Emotional arousal is high (0.80), so your system is \u201clit up,\u201d but not in a panic/stress way\u2014more like intense mental activity plus emotional charge. Signal quality is only 51% and \u201cartifact_detected\u201d is flagged, so I\u2019ll be a bit cautious in over-interpreting. I\u2019ll describe this as a sharp, highly engaged state with emotions running in the background, but not full distress.*\n\nRight now your mental state looks like: very switched on cognitively, low external stress, but emotionally \u201camped\u201d underneath. It\u2019s like your brain is in high-gear analysis mode while your feelings are quietly turned up a notch in the background.  \n\nIf you check in with yourself, does it feel more like:  \n- \u201cI\u2019m deep in my head / overthinking,\u201d  \n- \u201cI\u2019m calm but emotionally stirred,\u201d or  \n- \u201cI don\u2019t really feel much, just very mentally \u2018on\u2019\u201d?"
