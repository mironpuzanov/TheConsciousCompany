Services:
  • Backend:  http://localhost:8000
  • Frontend: http://localhost:5173
  • Muse LSL: Running (PPG, ACC, GYRO enabled)

To stop all services:
  pkill -f 'uvicorn backend.main'
  pkill -f 'vite'
  pkill -f 'muselsl stream'

Resource Usage:
  • Backend loads ML models on first request (throttled, ~2s delay between models)
  • Models stay in memory after first load (~2-4GB total)
  • M3 MacBook should handle this, but monitor Activity Monitor if issues occur
